This is my submission for the first assignment done for the course
*Data Acquisition and Survey Methods* during the summer semester 2025.

# Preparation

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Imports

The assignment is done mainly using the libraries `rvest` for data extraction
from the html and `dplyr` for processing of the data table.
```{r imports, message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(glue)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
library(rvest)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Global variables

As specified, the web page `timeanddate.com` is used as a data source.
My name is **T**obias Haider. My choice for the city is **T**allinn, Estonia, a city
that I like very much and has weather that is a little different from the
weather in Vienna.

Using `rvest`, it is easy to load all the web pages used in the analyses below.
Sources:

 - [Tallinn weather forecast (next 48 hours)](https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/estonia/tallinn)
 - [Tallin weather detail forecast (next 24 hours)](https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/estonia/tallinn/hourly)
 - [Tallinn weather yearly summary](https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/estonia/tallinn/climate)

```{r gloabl_variables, message=FALSE}
time_now <- Sys.time()

country_name <- "estonia"
city_name <- "tallinn"

weather_forecast_48h_url <- glue("https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/{country_name}/{city_name}")
weather_forecast_detail_24h_url <- glue("https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/{country_name}/{city_name}/hourly")
weather_summary_annual_url <- glue("https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/{country_name}/{city_name}/climate")
```

## Data download

With the `read_html` function a GET request is made and the response body is parsed as a html.
I am not interested in any status codes and just assume that the data downloads
succeed.

```{r data_download, message=FALSE}
weather_forecast_48h_html <- read_html(weather_forecast_48h_url)
weather_forecast_detail_24h_html <- read_html(weather_forecast_detail_24h_url)
weather_summary_annual_html <- read_html(weather_summary_annual_url)
```

# Analyses

Starting from this section, the pre-loaded html is processed. The strategy is
the following for all reports:

 - Locate the relevant element within the web page
 - Parse the table representation into a tibble
 - Clean up the representation so that the result is a valid data table

## 48 hour weather report

![48h forecast web page]("~/pCloudDrive/Studium/MSC Data Sciene/6/Data Acquisition and Survey Methods/Assignments/Assignment 1/report/tallinn_48h.png")

The main weather report is easily accessible. The page contains a `table` tag
with a static id `wt-48` (probably an abbreviation for weather table 48 hours).
It can directly be transformed to a tibble without custom parsing.

Afterwards, it is transposed and some columns are removed.

```{r 48_hour_weather_data_extraction, warning=FALSE}
weather_forecast_48h_parsed <- weather_forecast_48h_html %>%
  html_element("table#wt-48") %>% 
  html_table(na.strings = "-") %>%
  t() %>% 
  as_tibble() %>%
  slice(2:n()) %>% 
  select(3:12)

names(weather_forecast_48h_parsed) <- c("temp", "description", "feels_like", "wind_speed", "wind_direction", "humidity", "dew_point", "visibility", "precip_prob", "rain_amount")
```

Personally, I do not like having the weekday and the strings `morning`, `afternoon`,
`evening` and `night` in the table, because this data will lose its meaning if
time passes. To avoid confusion, I removed these columns and replace them by
calculated time stamps estimating the expected time for which the forecast is
made.

```{r 48_hour_weather_data_cleaning}
weather_forecast_48h <- weather_forecast_48h_parsed %>%
  mutate(time = time_now + seq(6, 42, by = 6) * 3600) %>% # 6 hour interval
  relocate(time, .before = 1)

kable(weather_forecast_48h)
```

The result is a nice table containing all the information from the web page.
It can now be used for reports and exports to other systems. Note that this
table is still not a valid data table, because the entries still contain a lot
of free text and unit characters. This is done in the next tasks and opens up
the possibility to plot the data columns.

## 24 hour weather report

![24h forecast web page]("~/pCloudDrive/Studium/MSC Data Sciene/6/Data Acquisition and Survey Methods/Assignments/Assignment 1/report/tallinn_24h_detail.png")

The detailed forecast is also easily accessible. The `table` element with the
id `wt-hbh` holds all the information we need.

```{r 24_hour_weather_data_extraction, message=FALSE}
weather_forecast_detail_24h_parsed <- weather_forecast_detail_24h_html  %>%
  html_element("table#wt-hbh") %>%
  html_table(na.strings = "-") %>% 
  as.matrix() %>% # there are columns with no name that prevent indexing
  as_tibble(.name_repair = "unique") %>% 
  slice(3:n() - 1) %>%
  select(c(-2, -7))

names(weather_forecast_detail_24h_parsed) <- c("time", "temp", "description", "feels_like", "wind_speed", "humidity", "precip_prob", "precip_amount")
```

For the time stamps, the same approach as before can be applied. First, the
initial forecast time is calculated. All following forecasts have an interval of
one hour.

```{r 24_hour_weather_forecast_start_calculation}
forecast_24h_start_time_hour_minute <- str_split(
  str_extract(weather_forecast_detail_24h_parsed$time[1], "\\d{1,2}:\\d{2}"), 
  ":", 
  simplify = TRUE
)
weather_forecast_detail_24h_start_time <- update(
  time_now, 
  hour = as.integer(forecast_24h_start_time_hour_minute[1]), 
  minute = as.integer(forecast_24h_start_time_hour_minute[2]), 
  second = 0
)
if (weather_forecast_detail_24h_start_time < time_now) {
  weather_forecast_detail_24h_start_time <- weather_forecast_detail_24h_start_time + days(1)
}
```

To be able to plot the values, all units are removed from the entries.

```{r 24_hour_weather_data_cleaning}
weather_forecast_detail_24h <- weather_forecast_detail_24h_parsed %>%
  mutate(
    time = weather_forecast_detail_24h_start_time + hours(row_number() - 1),
    temp = as.numeric(str_extract(temp, "-?[\\d\\.]+")),
    feels_like = as.numeric(str_extract(feels_like, "-?[\\d\\.]+")),
    wind_speed = as.numeric(str_extract(wind_speed, "[\\d\\.]+")),
    humidity = as.numeric(str_extract(humidity, "[\\d\\.]+")) / 100,
    precip_prob = as.numeric(str_extract(precip_prob, "[\\d\\.]+")) / 100,
    precip_amount = as.numeric(str_extract(precip_amount, "[\\d\\.]+"))
  )

kable(weather_forecast_detail_24h)
```

### 24 hour temperature forecast plot

```{r 24_hour_weather_temperature_plot}
weather_forecast_detail_24h %>% ggplot(aes(x = time)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = temp, color = "measured")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = feels_like, color = "perceived")) + 
  labs(x = "Time", y = "Temperature (CÂ°)", color = "Temperature")
```

### 24 hour wind speed forecast plot

```{r 24_hour_weather_wind_speed_plot}
weather_forecast_detail_24h %>% ggplot(aes(x = time, y = wind_speed)) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(x = "Time", y = "Wind speed (km/h)")
```

### 24 hour humidity forecast plot

```{r 24_hour_weather_humidity_plot}
weather_forecast_detail_24h %>% ggplot(aes(x = time, y = humidity)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(x = "Time", y = "Humidity")
```

## Annual weather report 

![Annual weather report web page]("~/pCloudDrive/Studium/MSC Data Sciene/6/Data Acquisition and Survey Methods/Assignments/Assignment 1/report/tallinn_annual.png")

Scraping data for the annual overview of the weather is quite tricky. The
reason is the `div` elements that do not follow a common table structure. Also,
the cells never just contain the clean numbers, but always some text or
description that has no value.

Still, it is possible to retrieve the data in a rather fast way. My approach
was to rely on the given div structure and, most importantly, the order of the
fields. With the CSS selector one can easily select all `p` tags containing the
summary data. The result is a 1D flattened array with the size of 108 (12 * 9).
For each month, there are exactly 9 values present:

 - high_temp (first occurrence at index 1)
 - low_temp (first occurrence at index 2)
 - mean_temp (first occurrence at index 3)
 - precipitation (first occurrence at index 4)
 - humidity (first occurrence at index 5)
 - dew_point (first occurrence at index 6)
 - wind (first occurrence at index 7)
 - pressure (first occurrence at index 8)
 - visibility (first occurrence at index 9)
 
```{r annual_weather_data_extraction}
months_html <- weather_summary_annual_html %>%
  html_elements("section#climateTable > div.climate-month:not(.climate-month--allyear) > div.four > p") %>%
  html_text()

weather_summary_annual_parsed <- tibble(
  month = seq(1, 12),
  high_temp = months_html[seq(1, 108, by = 9)],
  low_temp = months_html[seq(2, 108, by = 9)],
  mean_temp = months_html[seq(3, 108, by = 9)],
  precipitation = months_html[seq(4, 108, by = 9)],
  humidity = months_html[seq(5, 108, by = 9)],
  dew_point = months_html[seq(6, 108, by = 9)],
  wind = months_html[seq(7, 108, by = 9)],
  pressure = months_html[seq(8, 108, by = 9)],
  visibility = months_html[seq(9, 108, by = 9)]
)
```

Every cell contains a description that can be removed. The simplest approach is
to extract the number present using a regex. I do not exactly know when the
values are floating points and when not. Because of this, all floating point
numbers are accepted.

For personal preference, percentage values are divided by 100.
```{r annual_weather_data_cleaning}
weather_summary_annual <- weather_summary_annual_parsed %>%
  mutate(
    high_temp = as.numeric(str_extract(high_temp, "-?[\\d\\.]+")),
    low_temp = as.numeric(str_extract(low_temp, "-?[\\d\\.]+")),
    mean_temp = as.numeric(str_extract(mean_temp, "-?[\\d\\.]+")),
    precipitation = as.numeric(str_extract(precipitation, "[\\d\\.]+")),
    humidity = as.numeric(str_extract(humidity, "[\\d\\.]+")) / 100,
    dew_point = as.numeric(str_extract(dew_point, "-?[\\d\\.]+")),
    wind = as.numeric(str_extract(wind, "[\\d\\.]+")),
    pressure = as.numeric(str_extract(pressure, "[\\d\\.]+")),
    visibility = as.numeric(str_extract(visibility, "[\\d\\.]+"))
  )

kable(weather_summary_annual)
```

### Annual weather metric summary

With the clean data table at hand, the summary can be created with `summarise`
masic math function.

```{r annual_weather_summary}
weather_summary_annual %>% summarise(
  minimum_temp = min(low_temp),
  maximum_temp = max(high_temp),
  mean_temp = mean(mean_temp),
  mean_precipitation = mean(precipitation)
) %>% 
  t() %>% 
  kable()
```

### Annual weather temperature plot

The temperature is plotted as a line plot. By plotting min, max and mean values
with different colors, the spread of temperatures is clearly visible.

```{r annual_weather_temperature_plot}
weather_summary_annual %>% ggplot(aes(x = ymd(paste(2025, month, 1, sep = "-")))) +
  geom_line(aes(y = low_temp, color = "low")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = mean_temp, color = "mean")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = high_temp, color = "high")) + 
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "months" , date_labels = "%b") +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Temperature (CÂ°)", color = "Temperature")
```

### Annual weather precipitation plot

For the precipitation plot a bar chart is chosen. It is visibly more intuitive,
because with precipitation one likes to compare months and not only analyze
increases and decreases.

```{r annual_weather_precipitation_plot}
weather_summary_annual %>% ggplot(aes(x = ymd(paste(2025, month, 1, sep = "-")), y = precipitation)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "months" , date_labels = "%b") +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Precipitation (mm)",)
```

# Conclusion

This assignment shows how publicly available web pages can be used to retrieve
valuable data. It is quite straightforward to process the data using `rvest`
and `dplyr` methods. When the data table is at hand, creating plots with
`ggplot2` is also a transparent process.

With this said, I feel like it is risky to employ such scripts in an automated
manner. Many HTML tables are meant for visualization and not scraping. For some
tables I have noticed that the number of columns change depending on the city.
For example, precipitation is a field which can be split up into rain, snow, 
and potentially more. There is no specification on when and how this splitting
happens on the website.

Furthermore, the default language of the client (device) used, changes the 
parsed content. It is important to keep this in mind and make as little
assumptions as possible to keep the code robust.
